## Submitting issues

Please read the below before posting an issue. Thank you!

- If your question is about the Pricehubble API itself, please check out the [Pricehubble Doc](https://docs.pricehubble.com/). This project doesn't handle any of that logic - we're just helping you form the requests.

If, however, you think you've found a bug, or would like to discuss a change or improvement, feel free to raise an issue and we'll figure it out between us.

## Pull requests

This is a fairly simple wrapper, but it has been made much better by contributions from those using it. If you'd like to suggest an improvement, please raise an issue to discuss it before making your pull request.

Pull requests for bugs are more than welcome - please explain the bug you're trying to fix in the message.

There are a small number of PHPUnit unit tests. Unit testing against an API is obviously a bit tricky, but I'd welcome any contributions to this. It would be great to have more test coverage.
